- Not persistent yet -- once I learn enough SQL, I'll change the
  Server class (and maybe Channel, too) to keep a database up to date
  when something changes.

- Sending plaintext passwords in our POST requests is dumb. Either the
  server should *only* communicate over HTTPS, or we should do
  something neat with public-key cryptography, or the "password" field
  when you post should be replaced with an "HMAC" field (the latter
  two possibilities would almost certainly require Javascript, which I
  do not know).

- It's a drag having to manually include username/password with every
  message you write -- I eliminated "logging in" to make the protocol
  more stateless on the server side, but the client should still be
  able to "log in" by requesting a magic cookie.
