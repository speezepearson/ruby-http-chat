- Sending plaintext passwords is dumb. Either the server should *only*
  accept passwords (and login cookies!) over HTTPS, or we should do
  something neat with public-key cryptography (which would require
  Javascript, which I, alas, don't know.)

- Lower priority: as currently implemented, even conceptually simple
  operations like creating a channel involve dispatching multiple
  queries to whatever database we're using. This is correct but
  inefficient. Some sort of caching would be preferable.
